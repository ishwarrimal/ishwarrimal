### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer with 8 years of experience in the field. I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and helping others succeed, which is why I maintain a repository called [frontend-interview-preps](https://github.com/ishwarrimal/frontend-interview-preps) to help aspiring developers prepare for interviews.  

I also write articles on my free time in [Medium](https://ishwar-rimal.medium.com/)  

I believe in the power of free knowledge sharing and am currently learning to create content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm1NpJ02h-Ij8CVR2hVXZEw) to share my expertise with a wider audience.  

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading books, riding my motorbike, trekking, or cooking up a storm in the kitchen. I also founded (and closed) a startup called wishgee.com.

Thanks for stopping by my profile!

Current Org: Intuit  
Current Role: Senior Frontend Engineer  
Total Year of Exp: 7+ Years.
