<h3>Organizaiton</h3>
<p>I am currently working at <a href="https://www.intuit.com/in/">Intuit</a> as a <strong>Senior Frontend Engineer</strong>. 
  
Previously I have worked at companies like [Simpl](https://getsimpl.com/), [Cleartrip](https://www.cleartrip.com/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/in/home) and [Vyapar](https://vyaparapp.in/)</strong>.


<h3>Current side project</h3>
Based on my experience of attending as well as taking multiple interviews, I have created this ultimate <a href="https://github.com/ishwarrimal/frontend-interview-preps">frontend interview preparation guide</a> to help aspiring developers prepare better for interviews.

<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>In 2019, I took a break from my career to build <a href="https://wishgee.com">WishGee</a> for more than a year until I had to close it for financial reasons.</p>
<p>I have made the codebase public so that anyone aspiring to build a product can take a reference [link](https://github.com/ishwarrimal/wishgee-front-public). Feel free to fork and play around(only for learning purposes).</p>


<h3>More</h3>
<p>I write articles in <a href="https://ishwar-rimal.medium.com/">Medium</a> about things I find difficult to understand. </p>

<p>Trying to share experience and learning on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm1NpJ02h-Ij8CVR2hVXZEw">YouTube</a></p>

<h3>ETC</h3>
<ul>When I'm not coding you can find me 
  <li>📖 :  Tired of self-help books, so I've started reading fantasy, Suspense, Thriller, etc. A big HP fan.</li>
  <li>🏍️ : I'd be dead if I didn't go on a bike ride at least twice a month</li>  
  <li>Trekking: This is a recently acquired hobby and I am loving it. For starters, I've trekked to the EBC as a first trek. </li>
  <li>I love cooking, especially experimenting around until there is a storm in the kitchen.</li>.</p> 
</ul>
