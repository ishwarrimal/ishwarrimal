<h3>ETC</h3>
<ul>When I'm not coding you can find me 
  <li>📖 :  Tired of self-help books, so I've started reading fantasy, Suspense, Thriller, etc. A big HP fan.</li>
  <li>🏍️ : I'd be dead if I didn't go on a bike ride at least twice a month</li>  
  <li>Trekking: This is a recently acquired hobby and I am loving it. For starters, I've trekked to the EBC as a first trek. </li>
  <li>I love cooking, especially experimenting around until there is a storm in the kitchen.</li>.</p>
